## Synthetic and Real World Challenges
These folders contain a structured progression of SQL and data analysis challenges, starting from foundational querying and moving to advanced analytical problem solving. Although separated, this repository intentionally includes both synthetic and real datasets. While synthetic data allows for practicing without any noise and easily controlled scenarios, the real world datasets have inconsistency and can be messy to handle. In general, this repository represents technical development and a structured approach to skill building in SQL and data analysis.
