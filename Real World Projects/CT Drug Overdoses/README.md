 ## Key Findings
 - **Long-Term Trend**: Drug related deaths show a clear upward trajectory over time with rolling averages confirming sustained growth rather than isolated spikes.
 - **Substance Trends**: Fentanyl has become inscreasingly prevalent over time and now represents a significant share of total overdose deaths. Its dominance suggests not only a
shift in the drug supply but also its role in the modern overdose crisis.
- **Demographic Patterns**: A majority of deaths are concentrated among the 35-44 age group, represening the most at-risk range. Male deaths consistently exceed female deaths,
indicating a gender disparity.
