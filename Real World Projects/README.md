## SQL Challenges - Real World Data
This section contains analysis performed on real world datasets. As opposed to synthetic challenges, these projects emphasize working under ambiguity, incomplete context and imperfect data structures. These projects 
highlight data cleaning and preparation, analytical problem solving and structural transformation. Real world constraints do not exist in controlled environments. There may be a lack of primary keys or inconsistent 
formatting and in these scenarios the technical challenge becomes identifying what the data represents and not just how to query it.
