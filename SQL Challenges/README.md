## SQL Challenges - Synthetic Data
This section of the repository contains SQL challenges built on synthetic datasets. Unlike real world datasets that have ambiguity, synthetic data allows for controlled edge case construction and scalable difficulty
progression. These excercises simulate targeted analytical scenarios such as risk scoring systems, matrices, behavioral segmentation and derived metrics. Untimately, this enables intentional practice of 
transformational logic without confounding variables.
