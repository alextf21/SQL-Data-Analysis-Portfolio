# Challenge Structure
Each dataset is broken into 3 progressive sections:
- **Beginner**: Basic filtering, grouping, and summary statistics
- **Intermediate**: Conditional logic, categorical bucketing, and multi-column aggregations
- **Advanced**: Window functions, risk scoring logic, and multi-step analytical reasoning

## AI Impact on Student Performance
This project focuses specifically on student performance and the impact of AI tools in an educational setting. I Use SQL to investigate correlations between AI dependency, lifestyle habbits (sleep, study hours) and academic outcomes to determine if AI benefits or deters student success. 

### Columns
There are 26 columns so to summarize, here are some of the key columns used in analysis:
- Academic Performance: final_score, last_exam_score, grade_level, passed
- AI Usage: ai_dependency_score, ai_generated_content_percentage, ai_usage_purpose
- Behavioral Factors: sleep_hours, study_hours_per_day, attendance_percentage

### Analytical Insights
#### The AI Dependency Trap
I investigated the relationship between the percentage of content generated by AI and the final score.
- **Method**: Grouped students into AI reliance tiers (low, low-mid, mid-high, high) using CASE statements.
- **Finding**: As you might expect, the students with a lower AI generated content percentage had a higher average final grade.

#### Performance Benchmarking
Using window functions and subqueries, I establish baselines to identify outliers based on performance. 
- **Ranking**: Calculated a new column called grade_level_rank to see where students stand relative to their specific grade cohorts.
- **Insight**: Top performers averaged about 3.3 hours of studey and maintained a low average of AI generated content.

## Insurance Cost Analysis
This project analyzes an insurance data containing demographic and health related attributes in addition to medical insurance charges. I Use SQL and explore cost drivers of medical insurance. Create and identify high risk groups and utilize progressive querying techniques ranging from basic aggregation to more advanced analytical logic. 

### Columns
- age: Age of policyholder
- sex: male/female
- bmi: Body mass index, integer
- children: Number of dependents
- smoker: True or false
- region: Location, broken into 4 regions
- charges: Individual insurance charges

### Analytical Insights
#### Advanced Risk Scoring Model
I engineered a custom "Risk Score" metric using a CTE to cimplify complex policyholder profiles into a single integer. Logic: Assigned points based on high-risk factors. 
- +2 points for smoking
- +1 point for BMI >= 30
- +1 point for age >= 45
- +1 point for children > 2
- **Outcome**: This composite score allowed for a linear ranking of "most risky" to "least risky" policyholders to predict high-cost outliers.
